                <b>Description</b>
                <p>An Adaptive Moving Average (AMA) is an indicator similar to SMA, MMA and EMA.
                AMA changes its sensitivity due to the price fluctuations. The Adaptive Moving Average
                becomes more sensitive during periods when price is moving in a certain direction and
                becomes less sensitive to price movements when it become unstable.
                </p>
                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>AMA indicator parameters are: period, fast period and slow period.</p>

                <b>Description</b>
                <p>Developed by Tushar Chande in 1995, Aroon is an indicator system that determines whether a stock is
                trending or not and how strong the trend is. 'Aroon' means 'Dawn's Early Light' in Sanskrit. Chande
                chose this name because the indicators are designed to reveal the beginning of a new trend.
                </p>
                <p>The Aroon indicators measure the number of periods since price recorded an x-day high or low. There are
                two separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a
                25-day high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low. In this sense, the
                Aroon indicators are quite different from typical momentum oscillators, which focus on price relative to
                time. Aroon is unique because it focuses on time relative to price. Chartists can use the Aroon
                indicators to spot emerging trends, identify consolidations, define correction periods and anticipate
                reversals.
                </p>
                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>Aroon indicator has only one parameter: the period.</p>

                <b>Description</b>
                <p>Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures volatility. As
                with most of his indicators, Wilder designed ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind. Commodities
                are frequently more volatile than stocks. They were are often subject to gaps and limit moves, which
                occur when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A volatility formula
                based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility from gap or limit moves. Wilder
                created Average True Range to capture this 'missing' volatility. It is important to remember that ATR
                does not provide an indication of price direction, just volatility.

                <b>Description</b>
                <p>The Awesome Oscillator (AO) was created by Bill Williams. The Awesome Oscillator is an indicator used to measure market momentum. The Awesome Oscillator indicator is a histogram, it is similar to the MACD indicator – displaying the market momentum of a recent number of periods compared to the momentum of a larger number of previous periods. AO calculates the difference between a 34 Period and 5 Period Simple Moving Average. The Simple Moving Averages that are used are not calculated using closing price but rather each bar's midpoints. AO is generally used to affirm trends or to anticipate possible reversals. If the AO histogram is crossing above the zero line that’s indicative of bullish momentum, reverse is true as well - when AO crosses below that’s indicative of bearish momentum.</p>
                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>There are three parameters an Awesome Oscillator indicator has, one of them is necessary - the mapping. The second parameter and third parameters set perod, fourth - Moving Average Type. The last parameter sets the series type.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <b>Description</b>
                <p>Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that is displayed as two lines (bands): one drawn above a
                simple moving average of the price and one - below. These bands move closer to the moving average when
                price volatility is low and move farther away from the moving average when price volatility increases.
                </p>
                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>Bollinger Bands parameters can be adjusted. The default parameters are: 20 periods for the simple moving
                average and 2 for the standard deviations (the distance between each band and the SMA). Increasing the
                number of periods - decreases the volatility of the SMA, and decreasing their number - increases the
                volatility of the SMA. Increasing the number of standard deviations moves the bands farther away from
                the SMA, and decreasing - moves the bands closer to the SMA.</p>
                <p>Bollinger Bands parameters are the period and the deviation.</p>
                <b>Function</b>
                 <p>Bollinger Bands are used to determine how volatile a stock is. Stocks move between levels of high and
                low volatility, and when the Bollinger bands grip a stock, it is a sign that the stock is consolidating
                and that a breakout is inevitable. When the Bollinger bands widen, it is a sign that the stock has burst
                out into a new trend.</p>

                and the price is below it, the stock is considered to be in a downtrend. Also, when the price is above
                an uptrending EMA line, the Exponential Moving Average can act as a possible support level. In the same
                way, when the price below a downtrending EMA line - the Exponential Moving Average can act as a possible

                <b>Description</b>
                <p>KDJ indicator is a technical indicator used to analyze and predict changes in stock trends and price
                patterns in a traded asset. KDJ indicator is also known as the random index. It is a very practical
                technical indicator which is most commonly used in market trend analysis of short-term stock.</p>
                <p>KDJ is a derived form of the Stochastic Oscillator Indicator with the only difference of having an extra
                line called the J line. Values of %K and %D lines show if the security is overbought (over 80) or
                oversold (below 20). The moments of %K crossing %D are the moments for selling or buying. The J line
                represents the divergence of the %D value from the %K. The value of J can go beyond [0, 100] for %K and
                %D lines on the chart.</p>
                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>KDJ indicator has a lot of optional parameters:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a period for the %K value</li>
                    <li>the moving average type of the indicator for the %K value</li>
                    <li>a period for the smoothed %K value</li>
                    <li>the moving average type of the indicator for the %D value</li>
                    <li>a period for the %D value</li>
                    <li>multipliers of the %K and %D values for %J value calculating</li>

                <b>Description</b>
                <p>Keltner Channels are volatility-based envelopes set above and below an exponential moving average (EMA).</p>
                <p>This indicator is similar to Bollinger Bands, which uses the standard deviation to set the bands. Instead of using the standard deviation, Keltner Channels use the Average True Range (ATR) to set the channel distance. The channels are typically set two Average True Range values above and below the 20-day EMA. The exponential moving average dictates the direction, and the Average True Range sets the channel width. Keltner Channels are a trend following indicator used to identify reversals with channel breakouts and channel direction. Channels can also be used to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is flat.</p>
                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>There are six parameters a Keltner Channel indicator has. The "maPeriod" and "atrPeriod" parameters set the Moving Average period and Average True Range period. The "maType" parameter sets the smoothing type, the next parameter is the multiplier, and the three last parameters allow you to set the series type of Moving Average and the range series.</p>

                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>MACD parameters can be adjusted. The default parameters are 26 for the slow exponential moving average,

First, a multiplier is calculated based on the relationship of the close to the high-low range. Second, the Money Flow Multiplier is multiplied by the period's volume to come up with a Money Flow Volume. A running total of the Money Flow Volume forms the Accumulation Distribution Line.

                <b>Description</b>
                <p>Developed by Donald Lambert and featured in Commodities magazine in 1980, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions. Lambert originally developed CCI to identify cyclical turns in commodities, but the indicator can successfully applied to indices, ETFs, stocks and other securities. In general, CCI measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period of time. CCI is relatively high when prices are far above their average. CCI is relatively low when prices are far below their average. In this manner, CCI can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels.</p>
                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>There are only two parameters - the period and the series type.</p>

                <b>Description</b>
                <p>Developed by Marc Chaikin, Chaikin Money Flow measures the amount of Money Flow Volume over a specific period. Money Flow Volume forms the basis for the Accumulation Distribution Line. Instead of a cumulative total of Money Flow Volume, Chaikin Money Flow simply sums Money Flow Volume for a specific look-back period, typically 20 or 21 days. The resulting indicator fluctuates above/below the zero line just like an oscillator. Chartists weigh the balance of buying or selling pressure with the absolute level of Chaikin Money Flow. Chartists can also look for crosses above or below the zero line to identify changes on money flow.</p>

                <b>Description</b>
                <p>Developed by Marc Chaikin, the DMI measures the momentum of the Accumulation Distribution Line using the MACD formula. This makes it an indicator of an indicator. The DMI is the difference between the 3-day EMA of the Accumulation Distribution Line and the 10-day EMA of the Accumulation Distribution Line. Like other momentum indicators, this indicator is designed to anticipate directional changes in the Accumulation Distribution Line by measuring the momentum behind the movements. A momentum change is the first step to a trend change. Anticipating trend changes in the Accumulation Distribution Line can help chartists anticipate trend changes in the underlying security. The Chaikin Oscillator generates signals with crosses above/below the zero line or with bullish/bearish divergences.</p>
                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>DMI indicator needs six parameters: two periods: period and a period for ADX, a smoothing mode for whilders ad three series types (for +DI, -DI and ADX series of the indicator).</p>

                <b>Description</b>
                <p>TRIX is a momentum oscillator that displays the percent rate of change of a triple exponentially smoothed moving average. It was developed in the early 1980's by Jack Hutson, an editor for Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine. With its triple smoothing, TRIX is designed to filter insignificant price movements. Chartists can use TRIX to generate signals similar to MACD. A signal line can be applied to look for signal line crossovers. A directional bias can be determined with the absolute level. Bullish and bearish divergences can be used to anticipate reversals.</p>
                <b>Parameters</b>
                <p>There are six parameters a TRIX Channel indicator has. The next two parameters, "period" and "signalPeriod", set the TRIX and signal periods. The "maType" and "signalMaType" parameters set the soothing types of the indicator and the signal. Finally, the last two allow you to set the seires type of both the indicator and the signal.</p>
